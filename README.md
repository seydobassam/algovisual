## About

Algovisual is an algorithms visualization project. It can be used to visualize different algorithms such as: **Search algorithm**, **Pathfinding algorithm**, and **Binary tree algorithms**, so you can see how algorithms work and how fast they are and the difference between them.

The Project was made via Vue3 + Vite.

**You can visualize algorithms here:** https://seydobassam.github.io/algovisual/
